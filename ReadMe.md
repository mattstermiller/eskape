# Eskape

Eskape is a simple maze game that runs in a console. The object is simple: move from your starting position on the left
side of the maze to the exit on the right side of the maze.

The size of the maze is configurable to be as small or large as you want. It has 3 visibility modes that affect the
difficulty:
- (Easy) Full - Full visibility of the entire maze
- (Medium) Explored - Areas of the maze that you've explored so far
- (Hard) Sight - The area of the maze that is currently within sight of your character

Eskape is written in F# on .NET Core 3.1.
